# Mnist-neural-network
Making a neural network in both Python and C++ and training it to the Mnist database

mnist_loader.py creates the training_data.json file which will be used in the c++ network

The weights and biases from the python network.py file can be saved as json files as well and loaded to both
the network.py and network.cpp files so training does'nt need to happen everytime
